obs-shaderfilter folder
These are shaders designed for use with the obs-shaderfilter plugin for OBS. You will need to install obs-shaderfilter first before being able to access these shaders.

You can set up the shaders by creating a custom Filter by right-clicking on a source and clicking on "Filters". Add a custom filter and name it something you can remember (preferably, the shader filename). Browse to the location of your shaders. Make sure that "Load shader from text" and "Use shader time" are enabled.
